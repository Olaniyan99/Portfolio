                                <p>
                                    i have always been intrested in software devlopment ever since i was in middle school. At 12 years old i created my first simple web page with HTML and CSS. While studying in the Towson university I was introduced to object oreinted programming which is where my love for software development took off. I was an active member of the software engineering club in which i became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects. That and my previous interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby into a career. I took my first steps towards my new career in August 2018, i worked part time with the Baltimore Orioles. During my expreince there, i picked up SQL and learned alot from there. After working there for a year, i decided it was time to take my career to the next level. The following fall, i got the opputunity to work for UPS as a software developer coop in which i am currently still doing.

                                    I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
